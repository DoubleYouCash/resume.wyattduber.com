# Resume Website - https://resume.wyattduber.com
This is the resume website for my website. It uses a NodeJS npm webserver behind a reverse proxy. I got it from a template that can be found here: https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-resume

It is a subdomain of https://www.wyattduber.com/, which is a smaller website that serves as a "home base" for all of my various subdomains and projects. [Check it out!](https://www.wyattduber.com)
